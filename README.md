## About Me

I am Alexandru Boia (Gramps). I also started a blog (see below) back in 2013 as a tour journal, to share stories about my travels.

For about two years, I have closed my accounts on all social networks, including LinkedIn, so the blog has taken on the burden of what I used to write there, both in topics and in frequency.

I work in IT as a software engineer (a kind of programmer, just better), and Iâ€™ve been doing this since before StackOverflow existed. I also have a few open-source projects that I work on in my spare time, depending on availability, mood, and motivation.
